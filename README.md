The files I used to repair my Commodore 8296, maybe someone finds this useful. 
Its not my own work I just combined the XC9536 PLA from http://www.nightfallcrew.com/18/11/2009/xilink-cpld-xc9536-replacement-pla-for-commodore-64/
with the Equations from http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/firmware/computers/pet/8296/index.html

This is how it looks ![PLA](/pla.jpg)
